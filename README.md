# 📱 Task Tracker – React Native App

A simple and clean **Task Tracking Mobile Application** built using **React Native**. This project helped me strengthen my fundamentals in React Native—covering components, state management, event handling, and debugging workflows.

I built this while exploring the basics of mobile development and getting familiar with React Native’s ecosystem, debugging tools, and UI building blocks.

## 🚀 Features

- **Add Tasks / Goals** – Enter tasks using an input modal and add them to the list.
- **Delete Tasks** – Tap on a task to remove it from the list.
- **Reusable Components** – Clean separation of UI via modular components (e.g., GoalInput, GoalItem).
- **State Management with Hooks** – Uses `useState` to maintain and update the task list.
- **Responsive UI** – Works smoothly across Android and iOS.
- **Beginner-friendly Architecture** – Perfect foundation for understanding the React Native component lifecycle and debugging.
